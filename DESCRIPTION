Description: This package includes the function "HLA_Matrix" which takes as input: 
  1) the scrHLAtag count file including columns for CB, UMI, and HLA alleles (https://github.com/furlan-lab/scrHLAtag); and 
  2) the Seurat object associated with the scrHLAtag count file (https://satijalab.org/seurat/index.html). 
  scrHLAtag must be run on the BAM file(s) from the "corrected" (not the "dedup") step that has been processed using the single cell IsoSeq3 pipeline (https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/IsoSeq). "HLA_Matrix" will then: 
  1) Estimate the PCR duplication rate within UMIs; 
  2) Estimate molecular swap per UMI with the assumption that a particular UMI could only carry a single mapped molecule (HLA allele), and if more than one molecule are present these are PCR artifacts; 
  3) Correct Molecular Swap by keeping the copies per UMI with the highest occuring HLA allele; 
  4) Perform Dedup, which is removing PCR duplicates and reducing each UMI (now associated with a single molecule) to a single line; 
  5) Estimate conflicting HLA when alleles from a donor source and a recipient source are known and both occuring within the same Cell Barcode; 
  then, correct this conflict by assuming a cell cannot have both recipient and donor-origin HLA allele, keeping only the most occuring; 
  6) Create the HLA Count Matrix compatible with associated the Seurat object.
