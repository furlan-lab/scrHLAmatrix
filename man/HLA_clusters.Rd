\arguments{
\item{reads}{is the scrHLAtag count file including columns for CB, UMI, and HLA alleles (https://github.com/furlan-lab/scrHLAtag).}

\item{k}{is the number of clusters to partition the UMAP space into, e.g. the number of entities or genotypes you 'think' there might be in your captured sample.}

\item{seu}{is the Seurat object associated with the scrHLAtag count file (https://satijalab.org/seurat/index.html).}

\item{CB_rev_com}{is a logical, called \code{TRUE} if the need to obtained the reverse complement of Cell Barcodes (CBs) is desired; default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{geno_metadata_id}{is a character, the column ID of the Seurat metadata designated to distinguish genotypes, if this information is available. \code{NULL} by default or when genotyping information is not available.}

\item{hla_with_counts_above}{is the number of total reads accross CBs at or above which an HLA allele is retained in the matrix.}

\item{CBs_with_counts_above}{is the number of total reads accross HLA alleles at or above which a CB is retained in the matrix. Note: \code{stats::princomp()} can only be used with at least as many units (CBs) as variables (HLAs), thus the function will make sure that number of CBs is equal or more than available HLA alleles in the matrix.}

\item{match_CB_with_seu}{is a logical, called \code{TRUE} if filtering CBs in the scrHLAtag count file with matching ones in the Seurat object is desired.}

\item{method}{is the graph-based clustering method to be used for partitioning cells based on their HLA count patterns. The choice is between a Connectivity-based method: \code{"hclust"} or \code{"umap_hclust"}, a Centroid-based method: \code{"kmeans"}, or a Distribution-based method: \code{"mclust"} (for Gaussian Mixture Model). We found \code{"hclust"} had the best ability to separate allogeneic entities so we set it as Default. In some cases, applying hierarchical clustering directly on UMAP coordinates gives good allogeneic entity separation so we provide the \code{"umap_hclust"} option.}

\item{QC_mm2}{is a logical, called \code{TRUE} if removing low quality reads based on minimap2 tags is desired.}

\item{s1_percent_pass_score}{is a percentage (\code{0} to \code{100}) cuttoff from the maximum score (best quality) of the minimap2 's1' tag, which a read needs to acheive to pass as acceptable; default at \code{80} and becomes less inclusive if value increases.}

\item{AS_percent_pass_score}{is a percentage (\code{0} to \code{100}) cuttoff from the maximum score (best quality) of the minimap2 'AS' tag, which a read needs to acheive to pass as acceptable; default at \code{80} and becomes less inclusive if value increases.}

\item{NM_thresh}{is the number of mismatches and gaps in the minimap2 alignment at or below which the quality of the read is acceptable; default is \code{15}.}

\item{de_thresh}{is the gap-compressed per-base sequence divergence in the minimap2 alignment at or below which the quality of the read is acceptable; the number is between \code{0} and \code{1}, and default is \code{0.01}.}

\item{hclust_algorithm}{applies to \code{stats::hclust()}; is the agglomeration algorithm to be used. Values include \code{"ward.D"}, \code{"ward.D2"}, \code{"single"}, \code{"complete"}, \code{"average"}, \code{"mcquitty"}, \code{"median"}, or \code{"centroid"}; for more information: \code{?stats::hclust}.}

\item{kmeans_algorithm}{applies to \code{stats::kmeans()}; is the k-means algorithm to be used. Values include \code{"Hartigan-Wong"}, \code{"Lloyd"}, \code{"Forgy"}, or \code{"MacQueen"}; for more information: \code{?stats::kmeans}.}

\item{n_PCs}{is a numeric, representing the number of top principal components to retain in downstream clustering and umap analyses; default is \code{100} or the top 80% of PCs, whichever is smaller.}

\item{parallelize}{is a logical, called \code{TRUE} if using parallel processing (multi-threading) is desired; default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{pt_size}{is a number, the size of the geometric point displayed by ggplot2.}

\item{return_heavy}{is a logical, if \code{TRUE} it also returns the now processed scrHLAtag count file (minimap2 QCed, CB reverse comp'ed, etc..) but the returned object is significantly heavier; default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{...}{arguments passed onto \code{uwot::umap()}.}
